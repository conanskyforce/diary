When the first time came to  iran,it seemed almost everything are old and out-of-style.

But with deeper comprehending,I see there are so many similarities with China.

Salary almost same,but higher than China(avg).

Consumption level is also same.

Without money,you can not marry a lady too!But it¡¯s legal to marry at most 4 people here only if you have enough money!

Also another thing which is very interesting is the lady here,graceful and beautiful.it¡¯s so easy to see a beauty here!
