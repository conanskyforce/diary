The best investment way is education.

These two days.After the communication with my best friend in university.
Something reminds which deeped in my heart.
What's your purpose£¿
I have asked myself this question one thousand times.Maybe even more.
But with no answer.Day by day.Month by Month.I continue my boring lifes£¬driven by the things meaningless.
For so many people,their ultimate purpose is "Finding a good girl then marry","Earning some money then buy a house".I think it's so crazy,it's so insane.I mean we born to this world,only for eating,sleeping,sexing?Is there anything meaningful£¿£¿
however,the fact tells me.It almost impossible to find other things meaningful in China nowadays.
Something seems interesting is that the many young men without family wealth in advanced city I means "peking,shanghai,guangzhou,shenzhen",they think they are pursuing what they want,and they will come true their dreams.
But fact is that they can buy a 100 m2 house by more than 100 years hard working with their salaries.
It's just a house right?Why only this thing trap so many people?it's abnormal right?
Why can we do something cool?
Why traped by a rocked building.
